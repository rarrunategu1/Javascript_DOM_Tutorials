What is the DOM?

The DOM (Document Object Model) is created by the browser whenever
a web page loads.  It looks like a tree of elements to include 
parent and child elments.

This model allows us to interact with web pages in javascript 
to make changes to it.

We can make read and make changes to HTML elements, Css styles, 
href, src, alt and custom attributes.

We can even create new html elements and insert into the DOM.

Also we can attach event listeners to elements such as
click, keypress, submit and react to those with javascript.
